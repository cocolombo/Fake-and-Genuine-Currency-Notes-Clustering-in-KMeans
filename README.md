# Kmeans-Python
Clustering of Fake and Genuine Currency notes using Kmeans in Python

# About :
KMeans uses Unsupervised Machine Learning for making Clusters from the data provided. Clusters are groups of data which have similar characteristics among them. This project aims to classify currency notes as fake or genuine using clustering algorithm. 

# Dataset Description : 
The dataset consists of two features :- V1 and V2 which are two measured features of both fake and genuine notes.

# Understanding files and folders in project : 
<ul>
  <li>kmeans.py - Contains the code for the project</li>
  <li>banknotes.csv - Dataset
  </ul>
  
# Setting up the project : 
<ul>
  The following libraries needs to be installed for the program to run.
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Sklearn</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  </ul>

# Running the program : 
Run the program using Python Interpreter by typing <b><i>py kmeans.py</i></b> (tested on Windows 10).
